Homework 4: Distributed Hash Table

We successfully implemented the distributed hash table.
The output does not exactly match that of the pdf but it does 
clearly show all received messages. The code sometimes will print out the
contents of the kbuckets to show what is going on inside, if you wish
to see that more often you can add it with the print_kbuckets function
that is documented and implemented above the main function.
